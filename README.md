# SeamHealth


Prerequisites:
This is a simple guideline on how the project was built and how to understand this codebase.

Created a folder named components and nested the doctor folder inside the components. 

Inside the doctor folder is where you would find all the codes used for building the user interfaces.

RegisterDoctor components contains the form user interface where doctors register and input there informations and click the register button.

DoctorList components contains the lists of doctors informations processed from the backend database.

SearchDoctor component contains an eventemitter where users can search for doctors informations  used property binding.

The Code files organizes the application into cohesive blocks of functionality. The modules are used for building the angular blocks together.

Also, there's a service folder to Store and Interact with Data functionalities and common tasks (Interacting with the Database on Server). 

Spliting the app into such feature modules because that is the prerequisite to performance improvements and logic across components. 

Using Databinding for interacting with the component templates. 

Created a model folder, generally responsible for modeling the data used in the view and handling the user interaction.

This project was created feb 2021, i want you to know that this is my second assessment for seamHealth. That's why

i have other folders like the home, auth and footer.

It was a past project which was assigned to me, unfortunately it wasn't acknowledge. You can review and know my performance 

right from then to now. I decided to build on the same project. The only difference is the new folders.
